## Introduction

My wife and I play "Settlers of Catan".  Yes, it's meant to be a 3-4 player game, but let's just call it "practise".
After a game we will quite often say things like "I really thought 8 would have been rolled more often".

I _get_ statistics... I'm not good at it, but I truly do understand the basics of probability.  So, this app was born out 
of that idea of "Well, did a number roll as often as could be expected?"

## The App

The idea is to create a .NET Maui app that is loosely coupled and incorporates best-practice architecture.  I've had little luck
at finding good guidance, probably due to relative uncoolness of Microsoft's mobile development platform and its lack of maturity. 

So, this is a learning tool for me, with the idea that I will return to the app to try new (or newly discovered) ideas.  

If you're new to .NET Maui, (or you're me, returning to the project after a period of time) start with MauiProgram.cs and hope I 
lived up to my promise to write comments in the code.
